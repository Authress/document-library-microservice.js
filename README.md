<!-- This is an S3 Explorer for AWS. It provides a simple and straightforward way for users to login using SSO and explore available S3 Buckets. Everything is done in the browser and requires only minimal setup using either [AWS Cognito](https://) or [Authress](https://authress.io).

Rhosys hosts an explorer to use out of the box for the community. For obvious security reasons, this is a UI only tool, and makes ZERO api calls to anywhere other than AWS. The following is a link to that explorer. However, if for some reason, other than security there is a benefit to hosting a clone of this, feel free to fork the repo and make any necessary changes. Alternatively, please contribute! -->

## Troubleshooting
If you run into any problems just try running through the suggested [Troubleshooting steps](./docs/troubleshooting.md) and if that doesn't help, [file an issue](https://github.com/Authress/document-library-microservice.js/issues), we are usually quick to respond.
